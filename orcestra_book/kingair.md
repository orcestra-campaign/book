## Instrument

```{dropdown} SPEC Hawkeye
The Hawkeye is measures aerosol and cloud droplet properties. It is an outgrowth of the 3V-CPI, including all of the features of the 3V-CPI, with the addition of an FCDP (Fast Cloud Droplet Probe) in the front part of the sample tube, and the conversion of one 10-micron channel to a 50-micron channel in the 2D-S portion of the probe. In this way, the Hawkeye is actually a combination of four probes in one.
