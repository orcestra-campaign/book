# Data Policy

ORCESTRA encourages free use and access to its data and relies on the integrity of the scientific community to ensure that this open data policy does not diminish the contributions of those who collected these data.

ORCESTRA data are a product of the collective efforts of various independent research groups, whose efforts have often benefited from financial support by external funding agencies. The data represents years of work in developing, certifying, and operating instruments, often tied to specific research or Ph.D. projects. We ask users to respect the priority of the data collectors by coordinating their use of ORCESTRA data with the Principal Investigators (PIs) responsible for the data collection, and by clearly acknowledging the source of the data used in all publications and presentations.

For publications using ORCESTRA data, please include this acknowledgement:
