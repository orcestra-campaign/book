# Data

The ORCESTRA data is stored via an InterPlanetary File System [(IPFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/). The latest dataset is available at `/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org`.

For a first overview and to browse the data, checkout the public gateway: **https://ipfs.io/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org**.

It is recommended to use your own [local gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-providers) for an accelerated access.


```{dropdown}  More about IPFS

> IPFS is a modular suite of protocols for organizing and transferring data, designed from the ground up with the principles of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking. Because IPFS is open-source, there are multiple implementations of IPFS. While IPFS has more than one use case, its main use case is for publishing data (files, directories, websites, etc.) in a decentralised fashion.

## Data Policy

ORCESTRA encourages free use and access to its data and relies on the integrity of the scientific community to ensure that this open data policy does not diminish the contributions of those who collected these data.

ORCESTRA data are a product of the collective efforts of various independent research groups, whose efforts have often benefited from financial support by external funding agencies. The data represents years of work in developing, certifying, and operating instruments, often tied to specific research or Ph.D. projects. We ask users to respect the priority of the data collectors by coordinating their use of ORCESTRA data with the Principal Investigators (PIs) responsible for the data collection, and by clearly acknowledging the source of the data used in all publications and presentations.

For publications using ORCESTRA data, please include this acknowledgement:

> "ORCESTRA was made possible thanks to the support of the Max Planck Society (MPG), the European Research Counceil through Grant No. (XXX), the German Research Foundation (DFG), the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF), the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), the European Space Agency (ESA), and the US National Science Foundation (NSF), through Grant No. YYY".  [The specific data used in this study was made available by instution/person XY thanks with partial support from agency XYZ]

To ensure the recognition of contributions to the data collection, while promoting its open and respectful use.
