# Data

The ORCESTRA data is stored via an InterPlanetary File System [(IPFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/what-is-ipfs/). The latest dataset is available at `/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org`.

For a first overview and to browse the data, checkout the public gateway: **https://ipfs.io/ipns/latest.orcestra-campaign.org**.

It is recommended to use your own [local gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-providers) for an accelerated access.


```{dropdown}  More about IPFS

> IPFS is a modular suite of protocols for organizing and transferring data, designed from the ground up with the principles of content addressing and peer-to-peer networking. Because IPFS is open-source, there are multiple implementations of IPFS. While IPFS has more than one use case, its main use case is for publishing data (files, directories, websites, etc.) in a decentralised fashion.
