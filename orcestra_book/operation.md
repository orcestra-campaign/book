```{admonition} Naming scheme for aircraft measurements
:class: note dropdown

The naming scheme `<aircraft>-<year><month><day><letter>` (i.e. _HALO-20240810a_) shall serve as a clean and future-proof way to identify flights. The `<letter>` in the end of the scheme will distinguish between cases, when several flights will take place in one day.

For quicklook data the terminus `QL_<aircraft>-<year><month><day><letter>_<instrument>_<Version: Vxx>` is recommended.
```
