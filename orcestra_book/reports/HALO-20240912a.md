## Conditions

:flight_id: HALO-20240912a
```

The ITCZ was forecast to be very broad, with not well-defined edges for the circles to be placed as usual. This prompted us to take a step back and look into other potentially interesting parameters and phenomena to be probed. A wide area of low surface-windspeeds (doldrums) appeared to be one of the more interesting features. And it was decided to place circles inside and around this area in order to measure the doldrums, the trade winds south and north of it and potentially some increased moisture in the outflow of a convective system in the Northwest. 

On the day of the flight the forecast was confirmed with only slight changes. The broad ITCZ became evident from the very beginning as high values of IWV were measured close to its southern edge, along with a great variety of convective and stratiform clouds at low, mid and high levels. Cloud-free areas with very well-defined edges identified as cold pools were frequently seen. The conditions at the second circle were slightly different as we entered the doldrums. Cloudiness consisted mostly of high cirrus at and around flight Level, with virtually no convection even at lower levels. Clear indications of doldrums from dropsonde measurements. The third circle had some convection to the North with more clear indications of doldrums in the southern part, such as mirroring of clouds on the sea surface. On the EarthCARE underpass we exited the doldrum region and had stratiform mid-level cloud patches with the picture getting more convective to the south and the last circle, where we met again the southern trade winds. Well-defined cloud-free cold pools were frequently observed. Situation remained similar on the way back with deep convection including overshooting tops and anvils around Barbados.

## Execution

Take-off was a few minutes early as everything worked out well on the ground with no delays. Soon HALO was centered on track and climbed up to FL410. Just before entering the first circle (SE) all instruments were go, having resolved the trouble with the dropsondes. We entered the SE circle at its northern entry point and flew in a CW direction. After completing the circle, we transited to the second one creating a figure 8 and climbed up to FL430. On the entry to the NE circle the plane briefly adjusted its course until it was established on course. The circle was flown CCW. NE circle was completed with no problems. On the way to the 3rd circle (NW) we climbed to FL450. Due to traffic around us the clearance to drop sondes would be delayed and we were some minutes ahead of plan. To counteract we performed a short waiting circle in CCW direction. We then entered the NW circle, flew in CCW direction and soon after got clearance. In order to then complete the circle, we overshot our exit point by a few nm and then turned sharply onto the EarthCARE track. The EarthCARE underflight worked out well and after reaching the southernmost point of the track we immediately initiated the last circle (SW) in a CW direction. The circle was completed without problems. After completing the last circle, we came back to land.
