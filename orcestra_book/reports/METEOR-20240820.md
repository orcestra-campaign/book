## Summary

RV Meteor arrived at 9.5 N, 26.714 W just after 6 AM and then turned south/southwest to steam along today's EarthCare orbit. Around 8.9 N, we performed another microstructure measurement and CTD, in which additional straps were used to better secure the bottles. Following this, Meteor peformed a SEA-POL circle pattern before positioning itself on EarthCare's orbit to await the overpass. While there wasn't much precipitation around for SEA-POL to measure, it was good practice for aligning the ship at the appropriate heading and setting RHI scans to coincide with the EarthCare overpass. 

The daily status briefing and forecast discussion was held at 10:20, with plans to include mini science seminars in subsequent days.

## Remarks

- Radiosondes were launched on the normal 3-hourly schedule. Skew T diagrams are now being posted on a publicly-accessible [cloud server](https://swiftbrowser.dkrz.de/public/dkrz_34406075a1684be9b56a2669a90730f2/ORCESTRA/BOWTIE/Radiosondes/figures/SkewT/)
- SEA-POL continues to operate in single-polarization mode.
- Relatively clear skies allowed the raman lidar to attempt calibration of its water vapor channel.
- Incubation CTDs will now be performed every 2 nights instead of every night.
- Coordination with HALO planned for 21.08 and 22.08, but no HALO flight today.

## Plans

- 20.08: Follow EarthCare orbit SSW. Every 6 hours, perform an MSS, CTD, and SEA-POL circle.
- 20.08, 14:52 LT: EarthCare overpass with coordinated SEA-POL scans
- 20.08, 15:00 LT - 21.08 12:00 LT: Steam south along 26.7W towards Southern edge of ITCZ 
- 21.08 13:00 - 15:00 LT: Meet HALO in their southern circle at 5.5N, 26.7 W, perform coordinated SEA-POL scans
- 21.08 15:00 LT - 22.08 13:00 LT: Transit along southern edge of the ITCZ towards East
- 22.08 16:10 LT: Meet HALO in their southern circle at 6.0N, 24.66W
- 22.08 19:00 LT : Steam north towards northern edge of ITCZ
