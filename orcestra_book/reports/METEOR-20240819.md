## Summary

RV Meteor continues to steam towards 9.5 N, 26.714 W. Overnight, we conducted an incubation CTD, two SEA-POL circles, then returned to the same location for a second incubation CTD. We also conducted microstructure measurements. The morning was convectively active, with a mesoscale convective system occurring just to our south with embedded convection with echo tops to 14 km (tallest we've seen so far) and a broader stratiform region. This was followed by extensive precipitation near the ship and moderately heavy rainfall was experienced at the Meteor. By late morning, the convection was dying out to leave partly cloudy conditions for Meteor's continued trek southwest. We are continuing with the sequence of microstructure measurements, CTD, and SEA-POL circles every 6 hours, as well as the usual 3-hourly radiosonde launches.  

The daily status briefing and forecast discussion was held at 10:20. The previous day's deployment of oceanographic instruments went well and we will pick them up again in 7-10 days. The atmospheric instruments continue to operate.  

## Remarks

- Radiosondes were launched on the normal 3-hourly schedule. 
- SEA-POL continues to operate in single-polarization mode.
- Radiosonde plots are now being generated automatically on the local server.
- Coordination with HALO planned for 21.08 and 22.08, but no HALO flight on the 20.08

## Plans

- 19.08 - 20.08: Steam towards 9.5 N, 26.714 W. Every 6 hours, perform an MSS, CTD, and SEA-POL circle.
- 20.08 5:00 LT: Arrive at 9.5 N, 26.714 W (center of center circle of what was the planned HALO flight for Tuesday 20.08). Follow EarthCare orbit SSW
- 20.08, 13:45 LT: Meet EarthCare overpass, coordinated SEA-POL scans
- 20.08, 14:00 LT - 21.08 14:00 LT: Steam south along 26.7W towards Southern edge of ITCZ, 
- 21.08 14:26 - 15:26 LT: Meet HALO in their southern circle at 5.9N, 26.7 W
- 21.08 16:00 LT - 22.08 16:00 LT: Transit along southern edge of the ITCZ towards East
- 22.08 16:10 LT: Meet HALO in their southern circle at 6.0N, 24.66W
- 22.08 19:00 LT : Steam north towards northern edge of ITCZ
