## Conditions

Vertically pointing cumulus at takeoff, thin coverage of cirrus.   The ITCZ seemed to be characterized by an easterly wave or northward undulation near Barbados, and another near 45 W, so that it had a slight nortward tilt as it moved westward.  From the region of the EarthCARE overpass to the west there were very low winds, and convection seemed to be concentrated in the band between the outer two circles.  Convection extended to the west from the band, and there were large cirrus outflows, presumably fed by lines or squalls to the east of the overpass line whose cirrus blew into the north-easter part of the central circle and the south-eastern part of the northern circle. 

In the southern circle we had hoped to do a cloud loop at the top of the circle, but the area was remarkably clear, in what seemed like a big cold-pool basin.  There were some clouds that looked a bi tmore developed toward the center of the circle so we flew towards these.  They were forming at the intersection of different convective lines, and we looped around them to the south, sort of ringing the center of the circle before returning to its perimeter while maintaining the developing convection out our left window. 

The center circle encompassed lines of convection extending ESE-WNW through it in what seemed to be a central ITCZ region with low reflection and seemingly very low winds to the south of this circle, south of the main convective activity, and near the top of the southern circle.  One could imagine the band of convection in the middle of this circle as the southern edge, in which case a northern edge was intensified more westward, so that convective activity appeared to hop-scotch between the edges of the band.. 

The northern circle's southern flank skirted the edge of the deep convection, but never really sampled it. Conditions were supressed on the northern side and an extensive aerosol layer was measured.  The conditions were such that we glided along the southern edge, but outside of the main convetive region, on the outbound ferry, and along but outside the northern edge on the inbound ferry, providing nice contrast for the different sides of the ITCZ.  We went from being a water vapor flight on the south to an eaorosl flight on the north.

## Execution

- changed direction on approach to small circle because of iceing on the specMACS camera looking out the right window
- for the small circle an absence of clouds and flexibility in use of space caused us to detour to the center of the big circle where we flew manually around some developing congestus chosen by PI based on visual inspection  out of the cockpit window. Convection appeared to be forming  on the interesection of convective lines. This was more to the center of the circle than anticipated rsulting in a detour, but we seemed to have extra tim, so even with the detour we remained on schedule.
- had to stop sondings at about 8pm on the circle (after ten sondes), then didn't get permission to exist circle leading to some overlap
- received permission later and continued to fill in with sondes along center line
- didn't have permission to enter circle so we had to fly through it... communication on how to return to circle wasn't effective.
- didn't get permission to exit circle, so we had to continue on it.

## Impressions

 - 12:50 take-off, cumulus congestus growing on north end and preciptating on decaying (southern flank)
 - 13:10 climgint to 410... some congestus degraining at flight level (FL350).
 - 13:18 flying through cirrus topping out at FL400
 - 13:52 convection rising to flight level
 - 13:55 slight diversion around developing convection
 - 14:04 passing a convective cell that extended above the aircraft along our left wing.
 - 14:19 large cold pool boundary
 - 14:28 turning on to small circle to use left window, right is frozen .
 - 14:40 circling around a developing cloud on a large cold pool boundary
 - 14:45 waiting for permission for soundings
 - 14:46 flew circle around convection developing in the center maybe to FL350
 - 14:51 out of excursion turning on to big circle
 - 15:00 drop didn't show winds.. dropping again
 - 15:00 convection sampled in middle continues to develop and gro along the boundary.  More stratiform clouds at mid levels behind (east) of boundary
 - 15:14 stratiform layer shows up in lidar brightly, hardly in radar, at about 5.7 km.
 - 15:14 clouds condtinue to develop in center of circle.
 - 15:20 sugar to the south (at south point); stratiform laye rmostly interior toward center of circle
 - 15:27 crossing what seems to be another cold pool boundary that intersects with the deeper clouds in circle center
 - 15:43 cumulus in center  detraining into stratiform layers at what seems like flight level
 - 15:50 left circle over a big clear patch... central cluster now a cluster
 - 15:58 entering circle rising to FL430
 - 16:15 larger cirrus layuer edge, convection bubbling through to the NW
 - 16:30 thin cirrus just above FL430
 - 16:30 three or four developing convective cells ot the left, with extensive mid-level outflow and sheared toward the north it seems
 - 16:42 more thin cirrus at flight level for the past few minutes... at various levels
 - 16:52 had to stop dropping due to air traffic
 - 16:57 lots of isolated deep convective cells all around us, sometimes directly out the window
 - 17:04 huge sargassam below us
 - 17:08 on track, FL450
 - 17:18 line of convection nicely aligned with overpass, also dropped two sondes to make up for inability to drop
 - 17:22 cirrus cleared again to allow deeper lidar penetration
 - 17:28 passing over a lconvective line with clear to the south and midlayer startiform to the north
 - 17:36 flying longer over circle as we await clearance for circle.
 - 17:37 mostly sugar below us with some slight cirrus still working tis way into flight level from north and east
 - 17:52 on the circle and launching sondes.
 - 17:52 some lines of not particularly developing clouds... still a bit of cirrus
 - 18:06 some slightly deeper clusters but not directly below us... growing cirrus at flight level and higher.
 - 18:15 some wind aligned cloud bands, ragged, but deeper than sugar... cirrus layer above us.
-  18:25 thin cirrus shows up as -30deg C in IR, but -65deg as we fly through it.  Deeper (3 km?) band off to the side.
-  18:28 beautiful pair of convective towers off the left wing on south of circle
-  18:59 turning off circle to return home... still sugary with NE to SW alinged cloud rows
-  19:38 Crossing a convective line along which the convection deepens to the left... flying all along the northern edge
-  19:49 convective fingers reaching up off the left wing .. also some convection on the radar and now on the right wing
-  20:13 thin cirrus, and cirrus virga suggestive of supercooled regions, the insitu water vapor measurements could be quite interesting
-  20:40 landing
