## Track

Flight path superimposed on the natural color image from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16 satellite on September 23, 2024, at 17:25:07 UTC, which is the closes image to the EarthCARE overpass. The location of the aircraft at the time of the satellite image is highlighted by the orange triangle.

## Conditions
The CWV field defining the moist margins of the ITCZ bends to the north before reaching Barbados.
The surface winds on the other hand show a nice confluence line along the axis of our operations and E-S-E of Barbados leading us into the moistest (reachable) spots within the ITCZ.
In the course of the day, convection along this confluence line actively developed and the line together with frequent and strongly growing Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) moved northward.
In the morning and rather in the west we found shallow clouds mostly clustered in blobs or along lines and cold pools, with frequent towers reaching further up, but no extensive anvils.
Starting with `c_mid`, the southern half of the circles was typically covered by deep cumulunimbus with extended anvil shields and increasing convective activity.
The circle on the EC track, `c_ec` was very convective in the east and we had to deviate from the track to circumvent a deep CB in the north-east.
In the south of this circle, deep cloud systems with large anvils cover mid layer and shallow clouds. The preliminary HAMP IWV retrieval suggested about 60kg/m2 throughout the circle.
The EarthCARE meeting point was luckily in between two extensive MCS, but we could only stay on the track for about 10 minutes, meet EC and turn away again from a threatening MCS system.
The way back is mostly surfing the white anvils with overshooting tops in the distance and occassionally a hole in the anvils revealing shallow cumulus clouds below putting white spots and dark shadows on the sea surface.
A special note deserve the coordinated measurements with the METEOR research ship that was sitting 0.075Â°E of the BCO.
After take-off, HALO was overpassing the ship at 3000ft with BAHAMAS measurements running.
We climbed up to FL410 and started a 39nm sized circle after overpassing the METEOR again with instruments running and dropsondes in the circle, while SEA-POL was scanning into the same area.
A deep cloud with heavy rain was sitting over METEOR when we started the circle.
At the very end of the flight HALO passed again at about 3000ft over METEOR and the BCO right before landing.

## Execution
- take-off followed by a 35nm sized circle to climb up to FL410
- measurement circle `c_meteor` from 11:54 - 12:40 with 11 dropsondes in coordination with METEOR's SEA-POL scans
- flying out east we did three circles `c_mid` (13:12 - 14:07), `c_ec` (14:37 - 15:32), and `c_south` (16:00 - 16:55) with frequent deviations on the circle tracks (the "Pacman mouths") due to deep clouds and 12 dropsondes dropped each
- we further headed towards the EC track entering it from the south. EC meeting point was slightly further north than anticipated, but before the next major MCS that we had to shy away from. We were able to stay on te EC track between 17:15:25 and 17:23:46.
- afterwards, we manouvered our way west in wiggles avoiding the deepest convective clusters that we could not fly above.
- last circle `c_west` from (18:15 - 19:10)
- radar calibration wiggle on the straight leg crossing `c_west` and heading west at about 19:17
- before landing, we passed by METEOR and BCO again

## Impressions
### Area of METEOR coordination

* way out into shallow convection
* 11:48 over outflow top of clouds 13146
* 11:53:53 overpassing Meteor and entering measurement circle (deep and raining cloud above Meteor)
* 11:55 WALES runs stable
* 12:14 flying over thin stratus layer
* 12:22 surfing cloud tops again
* 12:25 last sonde out of c_meteor
* 12:26 turn east
* 12:40 FL430, thin cirrus
* 12:45 flying right above thin cirrus, looking through we can see shallow clustered clouds with towers here and there
* 12:57 thin cirrus, only very few and very shallow clouds below
* 13:11 circle c_mid. only few and shallow clouds in the northern part, 
* 13:23 deviating due to deep cloud, CWV suddenly at 74kg/m2, before rather at 50- 60
* 13:42 cirrus anvil again, but still on top of it
* 13:44 in cloud tops
* 13:50 nice overshooting tops to both sides of HALO
* 13:55 passing over a very deep cloud
* 13:57 into the circle the cirrus top looks flat. Looking outside we see many overshooting tops
* 14:07 flying east again crossing circle, still over thick cirrus
* 14:27 FL change to 450
* 14:34 we are flying through the cloud tops into the next circle and will continue to climb the last bit to FL450 before we start dropping sondes
* 14:41 we are passing by isolated towers that reach up to HALO but don't have an anvil yet. Interesting to see the various cloud top heights and cloud top shapes. THe towers slightly align in a row S-N direction
* 14:50 we are approaching anvils with overshooting tops again. 
* 14:55 deviating due to deep system. cloud tops (overshooting) right next to HALO
* 14:58 huge white anvil to both sides
* 15:11 clearing up again, we are leaving the anvil
* 15:29 nice cold pool below anvils facing outwards of the circle
* 15:32 leaving circle in the middle of anvil and overshooting tops
* 15:44 floating over white anvils, passing by overshooting tops
* 16:00 circle start with overshooting tops looking into the circle
* 16:08 deviating again a deeper CB
* 16:17 back on circle track, sometimes lower clouds visible. Anvil is not completely closed.
* 16:46 deviation due to deep DB
* 17:14 entering EC track in the south, all cloudy
* 17:24:15 leaving track again due to deep CB and manouvering back to the track heading west
* 17:58 all white, overshooting tops to the north
* 17:56 climbing to FL470
* 18:13 entering the circle c_west
* 18:36 white anvils again
* 19:05 we start to see cloud structures below us again :) far in the north some overshooting tops. shallow clouds below the anvils within the circle
* 19:11 leaving the circle path
* 19:16 radar calibration wiggle
* 19:26 start descending
* 19:39 Now that we are below the cirrus ceiling, we can see a few anvil clouds on our 9', and many towers on our 3'
* ?? overpassing the Meteor at 3000ft only BAHAMAS measurement. Lidar, Radar not running.
* ?? overpassing the BCO at 3000ft
