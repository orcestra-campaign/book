## Track

Flight path superimposed on the natural color image from NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16 satellite on September 14, 2024 at 15:20 UTC. The location of the aircraft at the time of the satellite image is highlighted.

## Conditions

```{track-animation}
:flight_id: HALO-20240914a
```

Basically any kind of clouds could be observed during this flight. It started with shallow convection and midlevel clouds. Later on convective towers among shallow convection and small sugary cloud spots could be seen on the way towards the first circle. The southern most circle was marked by lowlevel cumulus and midlevel clouds in the south and a full mid-level cloud deck in the north. 
In the second circle, a very thick cirrus (~7km) was seen, that was later replaced by a thick layer of mid-level clouds with very few clear-spots. Towards the end we crossed a deep convective cloud.   
In the center circle many cloud conditions could be observed: starting with shallow convection and small towers with thin midlevel clouds, condition changed to thin cirrus, towers and sugary clouds in the distance. Later on small low-level clouds could be seen that the radar did not see and again many towers. Towards the end we entered a coldpool region.
The underpass started in deep clouds and fully white sky. Two minutes before meeting Earthcare those cleared up and gave way to nice lidar conditions with only few shallow clouds.
The Northern circle was marked by clear-sky and some singular shallow convection and thin cirrus. Windspeeds were very low, especially in the North-Western part of the circle. 
The way back started with convective towers again and a cirrus layer later on. 


## Execution

 - flew southern most circle twice because of problems with the dropsonde system. 
 - problems could not be solved; so no sounding data in the southern most circle.
 - skipped small waiting circle as a result 
 - entered second southern circle from the north-east to by some time for the dropsonde team
 - third circle directly after second (both with okay soundings)
 - some holding pattern to by some time before Earthcare, because we were early
 - perfectly timed underpass
 - fourth circle as planned
 - back home
