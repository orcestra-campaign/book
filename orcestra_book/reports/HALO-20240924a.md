## Conditions

```{track-animation}
:flight_id: HALO-20240924a
```

Two tropical waves and a well defined ITCZ defined the synoptic situation over the tropical Atlantic for the day of the flight. The ITCZ was located to the east of the Atlantic, displaying a tilt, and roughly resembling its climatological position for the month of September. It spanned from about 40°W and 2°N, to about 7°N off the coast of Africa. At a longitude of about 25°W was the first of the tropical waves, propagating westward. East of Barbados, at a longitude of about 50°W was the second tropical wave, also propagating west. This last wave was a determinant one for the flight, destabilizing the atmosphere over the region spanned by the original flight plan, and leading to the development of multiple mesoscale convective systems that occurred around the flight area.

Notably, the flight took place after a persistent downwelling signal associated with the MJO, as observed in the 200 hPa velocity potential, had transitioned to neutrality over the Atlantic. This transition could have lead to the more active state of the Atlantic observed for the flight. 

## Execution

Originally circles were planned at two different locations oriented horizontally east of Barbados. We would have done the western circle once, then flown the eastern circle twice in a row, the western circle again followed by the EarthCare track in north-south direction with an underpass location a bit north of Barbados and would have returned to the western circle for a third time before landing. The idea was to study the time evolution of the convective systems, clouds and moisture by doing the circles repeatedly with one hour time difference in the eastern circle and with around three and six hours difference for the western circle. 
Unfortunately HALO could not depart as planned due to fueling issues what in the end caused the take off to be delayed by four hours. Because of that and additional problems with severe weather and very deep convective systems especially north of Barbados at the location of the originally planned EarthCare track, the flight had to be replanned in the morning. The EarthCare track and meeting point were shifted south and flown south-north. The eastern circle was skipped completely. 

Take Off took finally place at 15:37 UTC going east towards the entry point of the (originally western) circle. On the way there, we already had to fly a big curve to the south to avoid a big convective system. We entered the circle at 16:15 UTC and flew it counter-clockwise. From the beginning of the circle, dropsondes were dropped continuously every five minutes. In the southern half of the circle we had to deviate a little bit to avoid convection, in the northern half of the circle we had to shortcut significantly into the direction of the center due to another big convective system. After finishing the circle at 17:11 UTC, we headed southwest to the new start of the EarthCARE track. We started the track at 17:48 UTC following it northwards until 18:19 UTC and meeting EarthCARE at 18:03 UTC. Due to the big convective system in the north, we followed the EarthCARE track back south until the meeting point and went then east again to the circle. At 18:56 UTC the second circle was started in counter-clockwise direction at the same position as the first circle. In the meantime another convective system developed in the southern part of the circle which we avoided by going further south to sample this system inside the circle. The convection in the northern half of the circle had decayed by then such that we could fly this part along the planned circle track. The same circle was repeated starting at 20:02 UTC and we again deviated to the south in the southern half to avoid convection sampling the same system inside the circle as before. Due to air traffic below, we had to stop dropping sondes at 20:42 UTC. The third circle was finished at 21:06 UTC. After finishing the circle we did a radar calibration maneuver on the way back towards Barbados at 21:11 UTC. Landing was at 21:47 UTC.
