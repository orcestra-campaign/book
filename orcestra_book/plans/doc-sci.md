# Role of the Documentation Scientist

Typically the documentation scientist on HALO is flying for the first time.  Depending on the flight, and their competencies, their role may vary.  This document is intended for those providing scientific documentation, as opposed to technical documentation or photgrametery, or documentation for outreach, etc.  

In this case the documentation scientist is expected to do three things:
1. develop an idea of the flight
2. support the dropsonde scientist
3. support the PI in documenting the flight

## 1. Developing an idea of the flight

Two tasks are involved in developing an idea of the flight.  The first is to form preconceptions.  The second is to allow the flight to challenge these preconceptions.   

Developing preconceoptions requires looking at the flight plans in light of the synoptic situation.  What do you know or expect about particular phenomena being targeted? How does this fit with the run of past flights? Based on this what do you expect to see and what kind of observations could challenge your preconceptions.   T

Challenging your preconceptions involves gathering data and experiences that can inform the way you are thinking.   In a practial seense this means seeing the evolving conditions through the different instruments.  Ask their operators what they are measuring, what measurement principles are involved, and what their measurements are showing for this particular flight.  On board you should learn about:
 - lidar measurements of water vapor and aerosol
 - radar measurements of hydrometeors
 - passive microwave measurements of water (condensate, vapor) burdens
 - multi-spectral imaging in the visible (specMACS) and the infrared
 - spectral albedo measurements
 - sea-surface temperature measurements
 - profiles of meteorological conditions using soundings.
 - broadband radiative fluxes in the visible and infrared
 - insitu measurements of aicraft position and selected meteorological variables. 

 At times the operators will be busy, in this case be understanding if they wave you away, and simply ask them when would be a good time to come back to learn more about their measurements.

 ## 2. Supporting the dropsonde scientists.

 The main roles here are three fold; (i) manage communication with pilots and mission PI; (ii) keep track and document launches; (iii) monitor sondes and state of sonde system. 

### Managing communication 

This involves sitting in the back with the dropsonde scientist, wearing the head set, and serving as a liason between the pilots/mission-PI and the dropsonde scientist.  Specific tasts are to:
 - determine if drops are authorized
 - establish if the aircraft is steady on the track where the sondes are to be launhced. 
 - identify hazars that might interrupt launching.  These could be from weather, other aircraft, or to support coordination. 

 ### Track and documet launches:

 Here your role is to establish when drops should be made, and remind the dropsonde scientist when a lauch needs to be arried out.  To do this effectively it is important to track the aircraft heading, which could be a basis for dropping the sondes; wahch the sonde epacing on Planet; and third, keep track of the time spacing between sondes.

 When monitoring the launch of the sonde check:
 - has a channel for the sonde to coommunicate been well chosen
 - is the sonde receiveing GPS signals
 - check that the pin has been removed, the parachute ribbon is not taped, but rather partially unrapped, and that the plastic covering of the sonde sensors (the read cap) has been removed.

 WHen the sonde has been launched:
  - look for a 'launch detect'
  - place a marker at the approximate launch point
  - indicate if the launch was successful.
  - monitor the evolving soundings.  Look at the data, identify surprises, is their constency around the circles.
  - discuss what you see with the sonde operator so that everyone remains alert.

  ## 3. Documenting the flight.

  The docu-scientist is responsible for the PI camera, this means passing it to the hamp operatore at the end of the flight.  In their other roles the mission PI is additionaly responsible for photo documentation with the flight camera, and for helping communication within the flight, i.e., where we are on the circle, are their changes, can we change altitude? 

At times the operators will be busy, in this case be understanding if they wave you away, and simply ask them when would be a good time to come back to learn more about their measurements.  At this point it might also be helpful to use and observe with your own instrument, which are your two eyes, perhaps aided by the PI camera.

## 2. Supporting the dropsonde scientists.

The main roles here are three fold; (i) manage dropsonde communication with pilots and mission PI; (ii) keep track and document dropsonde launches; (iii) monitor sondes and the state of sonde system. 

### Managing communication 

To manage the communication you should sit in the back with the dropsonde scientist, wearing the head set, and serving as a liason between the pilots/mission-PI and the dropsonde scientist.  Specific tasts are to:
 1. determine if drops are authorized
 2. establish if the aircraft is steady on the track where the sondes are to be launhced. 
 3. identify hazards (e.g., weather, other aircraft in the area) that might interrupt launching. 

 ### Track and documet launches:

 Here your role is to establish when drops should be made, and discuss with the dropsonde scientist when a lauch needs to be carried out.  To do this effectively it is important to track the aircraft heading, which could be a basis for dropping the sondes; watch the sonde epacing on Planet; and third, keep track of the time interval between sondes.

*When monitoring the launch of the sonde check:*
 
 - decide whether to replace a failed launch?
 - has a channel for the sonde to coommunicate been well chosen and established?
 - is the sonde receiveing GPS signals?
 - is the sonde ready for launch: (i) has the power pin been removed? (ii) is the parachute ribbon free (tape-removed) and partially unrapped; (iii) has the red plastic covering of the sonde sensors been removed?

*When the sonde has been launched:*
  - place a marker at the approximate launch point on Planet
  - confirm the 'launch detect' (with dropsonde scientist)
  - indicate if the launch was successful (launch detect), and if not respond as decided previously.
  - continue to monitor the evolving soundings to ensure it is collecing data.
  - evaluate the data scientifically. Is their constency around the circles? Do you see special features?
  - discuss what you see with the sonde operator so that everyone remains alert.

## 3. Documenting the flight.

The docu-scientist is responsible for the PI camera.  This means checking its readiness before the flight. Using it effectively to document conditions on the flight. And passing it to the HAMP operatore at the end of the flight so that the data can be collected on the data-server.  
  
In addition to photo-documentaiton the docu-scientist should maintain notes describing the evolving conditions, and documenting anomalies, also in the functioning of instrumentation or the execution of the flight plan. THe docu-scientist can also be very helpfuil in managing communication within the flight, i.e., where we are on the circle, are their changes, can we change altitude, is this information being communicated to the crew?
