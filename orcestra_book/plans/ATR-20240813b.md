# Flight plan - {front}`flight_id`

```{badges}
```

## Flight plan
* The flight is planned to take off at {front}`takeoff` UTC and land at {front}`landing` UTC.
* Coordination with HALO (with a HALO circle
 centered above our transect, around 15.5 N, 22.1 W)
* flight track designed for coordination with SAR on Sentinel-1 at 19:42 UTC
 (to study coherent structures near the ocean surface)
* opportunity to sample the Northern edge of the ITCZ
* nighttime conditions (better range for Raman lidar)
* not too far from METOP-B (23 UTC)
