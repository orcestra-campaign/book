# Flight plan - {front}`flight_id`

```{badges}
```

## Flight plan
* The flight is planned to take off at {front}`takeoff` UTC and land at {front}`landing` UTC.
* Flight track designed to sample conditions behind the African Easterly Wave Trough
* Previous flight followed the same track and sampled conditions ahead of the African Easterly Wave Trough (the trough passed by in-between flights)
* NOTE: flight plan was modified in-flight to sample deep convection further to the south of the planned waypoints
