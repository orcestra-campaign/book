# Attribute Convention for ORCESTRA

## Goals

The goal of this convention is to define a minimal set of global attributes for datasets to provide the following functionalities:

* Automatically retrieve contact information for any dataset
* Create a summary table with all datasets and some key metadata

For additional metadata not covered by this convention we recommend following the [CF](https://cfconventions.org) and [ACDD](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Attribute_Convention_for_Data_Discovery_1-3) conventions.

## Global attributes

The following section lists a selection of required and recommended global attributes for datasets.
The required attributes are essential for the [ORCESTRA Data Browser](https://browser.orcestra-campaign.org) to render proper landing pages.

If an attribute is undefined, it is recommended not to set it instead of using empty strings.
