# Virtual Campaign (VC)

**📅 When?** Thursday and Friday in January/February 2024 for four weeks

Starting from 11th January we meet every Thursday and Friday (🕰  1 -- 5 pm UTC | 2 -- 6 pm CET | 8 am -- 12 pm EDT)

---

## The overarching aim of the VC

I.) People shall get to know each other and voice their research interest. We envision first definitions of **basic flight patterns** that everyone generally agrees with and list special patterns that we might need to cover during the campaign (e.g. radar calibration wiggle). Also, we should get a feeling for the boundary conditions for the campaign: what happens in case of a tropical cyclone or the like?

II.) Start **collecting tools/scripts/datasets** that are useful during the campaign for flight planning or first data evaluation.

---

## Schedule

**Group work:** We envision groups of about 5 people to work in parallel to plan the flights and ship track. We suggest to divide the group work into two phases:
- (Week 1 and 2) Come up with the ship track and a generic flight pattern based on the observed variability of the atmospheric conditions.
- (Week 3 and 4) Handle a specific real-day case study from the past and come up with a realistic flight plan.

**All times are CET.**
